## Backend Requirements

To set up the backend environment, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Regenerating `requirements.txt`

If the `requirements.txt` file needs to be regenerated (for example, if dependencies have changed), you can do so by running the following command from the backend directory:

```bash
pipreqs . --force
